# Bulk-Image-Editor
This project aims to enable bulk editing of images. The program allows you to import an image from your computer, adjust parameters such as brightness and contrast, and save these settings for reuse. You can then apply the same settings to an entire folder of photos. The resulting images are saved within the original folder.
